# Yelp-Dataset-Challenge

Yelp hosts an annual challenge for all sorts of computer scientists and provides a comprehensive set of data that includes business information, user information, reviews, tips, check-in information, and even a large photo library.
Using the data provided I will analyze what attributes and features make a well-ranked restaurant and a well-ranked user as well as conducting sentiment analysis on the review text.
If needed I will also utilize the Yelp API to apply my models to current data from whereever a user would like.
The potential stakeholders would be the businesses that can see what factors will affect their businesses reputation as well as the users who will be able to distinguish between credible reviews with good content or reviews that are not informative. Yelp may also be a potential stakeholder because the model could be used to sift through reviews to prioritize the better reviews on the page as opposed to the spam reviews.
