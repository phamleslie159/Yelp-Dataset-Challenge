# Yelp-Dataset-Challenge

Yelp presents a challenge to all programmers to devise new innovative ways to interpret and analyze business data provided by Yelp. The datasets include business data, anonymized user data, check-in data, as well as user reviews and tips. I chose this data because the data is very thorough and provides a lot of options for how it can be analyzed. I used Natural Language Processing with the User Reviews and Tips, Data Visualizations with the User and Business data and Time Series with the User and Business data. There is much more that can be done with the data.
